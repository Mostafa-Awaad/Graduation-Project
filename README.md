We developed a machine learning model, in which we used Machine learning frameworks: (TensorFlow and Keras),
Python Visualization Libraries: (Matplotlib and MNE), Pandas Library for data manipulation, scikit-learn library for
data classification and statistical modelling, MATLAB Engine API for Python, SciPy Library for scientific computing
and technical computing to classify patients’ intentions and make predictions for the servo motor of the exoskeleton arm
that we designed to move based on offline dataset. We then made the ML trained. Using the trained model, we were able
to record online dataset using UNICORN HYBRID BLACK headset and classify the patients’ intentions to make
predictions for the intended motion using Lab Streaming Layer communication protocol and mapping these intentions to
near real-time movement for the exoskeleton arm
